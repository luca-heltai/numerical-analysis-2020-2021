## Course information

This is a Joint course, between SISSA PhD in Mathematical Analysis, Modeling, and Applications, Laurea Magistrale in Matematica, Laurea Magistrale in Data Science and Scientific Computing, and Master in High Performance Computing.

Due to the large number of diverse groups that will follow the course, and for security protocols, only students with a Scholarship from SISSA will be allowed to follow some of the lectures in presence (SISSA PhD students, LM scholarship holders, DSSC scholarship holders) and few other students from Mathematics. DSSC and MHPC students will be connected online this year.

All lectures will be streamed online using the Zoom platform, and recorded live on YouTube. A link with the lecture will be provided to the students at the end of every lecture.

According to the availability of the teachers, some lectures will be delivered live in one of SISSA classrooms.

The following Zoom link will be used for the lectures:

Meeting ID: 857 9687 3697
Passcode: NumAna

You will find a recording of all lectures in this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLArvQL9bsv1y6BhTNOthBj1hGijN3vuCh).
